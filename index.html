               I don't want to bore anyone right off the bat, so we'll quickly run through the early days of my professional life.  
               It may seem unrelated, but part of it does in fact impact where I am today.  
               When I was 16-17, during the summer between my junior and senior year of high school, I worked at a nice little marina restaurant.  The Leaky Bucket.
               Now this isn't the part that really ties to today in any way, but I always like to take an oppurtunity to discuss the wonderful pies that were made and sold there.
               Anyway, onto my senior year of high school where half of my day was taken up at a vocational school to get my CNA license.
               The original intent was to go into nursing.  While I have always had a love of technology and was more tech savvy than my peers or my family, I never once thought to pursue it as a career option back then.
               So nursing it was.  I have always enjoyed the field, even to this day since i'm still adjacent to it.  But i'm getting ahead of myself.
               After high school I had my CNA license!  So it secured me a job at an assisted living community near my home town.  
               I did like the job.  It got me through a couple years of community college while I lived with my parents and took classes in the evenings.  
               But the time eventually came to move out of my parents home and set off on my own.  So I quit and moved an hour and half away to Edwardsville.

               Now that I had moved to a new location, I needed a job of course.  
               With my CNA license, it was easy.  Landed an interview at the first place I walked in to fill out an application.
               That place was Cedarhurst of Edwardsville.  I spent 2015-2017 as a simple CNA, working floor while trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.
               I came to love the place and everyone there, so I knew it quite well.  Eventually, a management position opened up that I landed.  Resident Care Manager.  
               Basically it boiled down to being a staff manager for the other RA's/CNA's and dealing with scheduling.  I did it for about 7 months before the next position opened up.
               Business Office Manager.  Now this is where I stayed from late 2018 to March 2020.  I truly shined in this position.  My eye for detail resulted in immaculate accounting procedure and organization of the employee file structure like the building had never had before.
               Because of friends I made within the company and the great job I did, it wasn't long before I caught the attention of the higher ups in the company.  I was frequently requested to be sent to other buildings all over the country to train new Business Office Managers.
               I also worked with some of the corporate teams to assist with audits of other communities.  It was a wonderful experience.  In March of 2020 I moved on from the Edwardsville location and was requested to pilot a new position in the company.
               The Talent Acquisition Coordinator.  It was a try at a recruitment and screening position over 10 buildings, and at the height of COVID let's just say the position didn't work out very well.  
               It felt like banging my head against the wall.  Calling out constantly with very little return for the work I was putting in.  Hearing the buildings I was over lament at how desparate they were for staff.  It was not a rewarding experience.
               Luckily, after 3 months a new position opened at the corporate office under a wonderful woman I had the pleasure of working with in the past.  So just like that I was the company's new Assistant Director of Education and Training.
               Now this job saw me creating training videos, collaborating on different programs, and traveling a lot.  In addition to my own job, the fall of 2021 was a sort of all hands on deck period for the corporate teams because we were acquiring a large number of new buildings.
               Most of my team was involved in the acquisitions process.  I would go to buildings ranging from Wisconsin to Florida and lead in acquisitions and train our new staff on our systems, as well as work with HR to onboard all of the new employees.  Once I even filled in for IT and installed a new firewall, cloudkey, and wifi access points all through a building in Kenosha Wisconsin.  
               It was a fun experience and I feel like I grew a lot from it.  When the acquisitions were wrapping up, was when I had found out about the LaunchCode program and started to apply.  Thankfully, I got in to it!  
               But enrolling in LaunchCode wasn't the only change that was coming in my life.

               One day came where I was pulled into an office and found out that a large partner wasn't renewing their contract with Cedarhurst.  So of our 84 buildings we were losing 21.  This particular ownership group is one we fought with a lot, so the writing had been on the wall.
               Unfortunately, with that level of loss from the company's bottom line there had to be some layoffs.  My position was one that got folded.  So I had lost that job.  The COO of the company, who I was very friendly with, sat in on that conversation.  
               After letting me know my position wouldn't be long for this world, he stated they wanted to do whatever they could to keep me in the company.  For this, I am grateful because a lot of others lost their jobs and weren't so fortunate.  
               Of the options offered, I chose an Executive Director position in charge of the Jacksonville IL location.  So here we are today!  I am enrolled in LaunchCode with plans to pursue my love of tech in the future, while simultaniously responsible for a staff of around 40 people in a community with 80 residents. 
               Pictured below is myself in Cedarhust of Jacksonville's foyer with my management team.  It's a busy life, but i'm quite happy with my place in the world.
